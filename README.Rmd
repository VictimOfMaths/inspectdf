[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/alastairrushworth/inspectdf.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/alastairrushworth/inspectdf)  [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/alastairrushworth/inspectdf/branch/master/graph/badge.svg)](https://codecov.io/gh/alastairrushworth/inspectdf)


Overview
---

`inspectdf` is collection of utilities for columnwise summary, comparison and visualisation of data frames.  Functions are provided to summarise missingness, categorical levels, numeric distribution, correlation, column types and memory usage.  

The package has three aims:  
+ to speed up repetitive checking and exploratory tasks for data frames  
+ to make it easier to compare data frames for differences and inconsistencies  
+ to support quick visualisation of data frames


Key functions
---  

+ `inspect_types()` summary of column types
+ `inspect_mem()` summary of memory usage of columns
+ `inspect_na()` columnwise prevalence of missing values
+ `inspect_cor()` correlation coefficients of numeric columns
+ `inspect_imb()` feature imbalance of categorical columns
+ `inspect_num()` summaries of numeric columns
+ `inspect_cat()` summaries of categorical columns



Installation 
---

To install the development version of the package, use
```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("alastairrushworth/inspectdf")

# load the package
library(inspectdf)
```

```{r, echo = FALSE}
library(inspectdf)
```



Illustrative data: `starwars`
---

The examples below make use of the `starwars` data from the `dplyr` package

```{r}
# some example data
data(starwars, package = "dplyr")
```

For illustrating comparisons of dataframes, use the `starwars` data and produce two new dataframes `star_1` and `star_2` that randomly sample the rows of the original and drop a couple of columns.

```{r, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(dplyr)
star_1 <- starwars %>% sample_n(50)
star_2 <- starwars %>% sample_n(50) %>% select(-1, -2)
```


#### Column types 

##### `inspect_types()` for a single dataframe

To explore the column types in a data frame, use the function `inspect_types()`.  The command returns a `tibble` summarising the counts and percentages of columns with particular types.  A barplot is also returned when `show_plot = TRUE`.

```{r}
# return tibble and visualisation of columns types
inspect_types(starwars, show_plot = TRUE)
```

##### `inspect_types()` for two dataframes

When a second dataframe is provided, `inspect_types()` will create a dataframe comparing the count and percentage of each column type for each of the input dataframes.  The summaries for the first and second dataframes are show in columns with names appended with `_1` and `_2`, respectively.

```{r}
inspect_types(star_1, star_2, show_plot = TRUE)
```



#### Memory usage

##### `inspect_mem()` for a single dataframe

To explore the memory usage of the columns in a data frame, use `inspect_mem()`.  The command returns a `tibble` containing the size of each column in the dataframe.  A barplot is also returned when `show_plot = TRUE`.

```{r}
inspect_mem(starwars, show_plot = TRUE)
```

##### `inspect_mem()` for two dataframes

When a second dataframe is provided, `inspect_mem()` will create a dataframe comparing the size of each column for both input dataframes.  The summaries for the first and second dataframes are show in columns with names appended with `_1` and `_2`, respectively.

```{r}
inspect_mem(star_1, star_2, show_plot = TRUE)
```


#### Missing values

##### `inspect_na()` for a single dataframe

`inspect_na()` summarises the prevalence of missing values by each column in a data frame.  A tibble containing the count (`cnt`) and the overall percentage (`pcnt`) of missing values is returned  A barplot is also returned when `show_plot` is set to `TRUE`.

```{r}
inspect_na(starwars, show_plot = TRUE)
```

##### `inspect_na()` for two dataframes

When a second dataframe is provided, `inspect_na()` returns a tibble containing counts and percentage missingness by column, with summaries for the first and second data frames are show in columns with names appended with `_1` and `_2`, respectively.  In addition, a $p$-value is calculated which provides a measure of evidence of whether the difference in missing values is significantly different.

```{r}
inspect_na(star_1, star_2, show_plot = TRUE)
```

Notes:

+ Smaller $p$-values indicate stronger evidence of a difference in the missingness rate for a single column
+ If a column appears in one data frame and not the other - for example `height` appears in `star_1` but nor `star_2`, then the corresponding `pcnt_`, `cnt_` and `p_value` columns will contain `NA`
+ Where the missingness is identically 0, the `p_value` is `NA`.
+ The visualisation illustrates the significance of the difference using a coloured bar overlay.  Orange bars indicate evidence of equality or missingness, while blue bars indicate inequality.  If a `p_value` cannot be calculated, no coloured bar is shown.
+ The significance level can be specified using the `alpha` argument to `inspect_na()`.  The default is `alpha = 0.05`.


#### Correlation

##### `inspect_cor()` for a single dataframe

`inspect_cor()` returns a tibble containing Pearson's correlation coefficient, confidence intervals and $p$-values for pairs of numeric columns .  The function combines the functionality of `cor()` and `cor.test()` in a more convenient wrapper.  A point and whiskers plot is also returned when `show_plot = TRUE`.

```{r}
inspect_cor(starwars, show_plot = T)
```

Notes

+ The tibble is sorted in descending order of the absolute coefficient $|\rho|$.
+ `inspect_cor` drops missing values prior to calculation of each correlation coefficient.  
+ The `p_value` is associated with the null hypothesis $H_0: \rho = 0$.

##### `inspect_cor()` for for two dataframes

When a second dataframe is provided, `inspect_cor()` returns a tibble that compares correlation coefficients of the first dataframe to those in the second.  The `p_value` column contains a measure of evidence for whether the two correlation coefficients are equal or not.  

```{r}
inspect_cor(star_1, star_2, show_plot = TRUE)
```

Notes:

+ Smaller `p_value` indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis $H_0: \rho_1 = \rho_2$ and an indication that the true correlation coefficients differ.
+ The visualisation illustrates the significance of the difference using a coloured bar overlay.  Orange bars indicate evidence of equality of correlations, while blue bars indicate inequality.  If a `p_value` cannot be calculated, no coloured bar is shown.
+ The significance level can be specified using the `alpha` argument to `inspect_cor()`.  The default is `alpha = 0.05`.



#### Feature imbalance

##### `inspect_imb()` for a single dataframe

Understanding categorical columns that are dominated by a single level can be useful.  `inspect_imb()` returns a tibble containing categorical column names (`col_name`); the most frequently occurring categorical level in each column (`value`) and `pctn` & `cnt` the percentage and count which the value occurs.  The tibble is sorted in descending order of `pcnt`.  A barplot is also returned when `show_plot` is set to `TRUE`.

```{r}
inspect_imb(starwars, show_plot = TRUE)
```

##### `inspect_imb()` for two dataframes

When a second dataframe is provided, `inspect_imb()` returns a tibble that compares the frequency of the most common categorical values of the first dataframe to those in the second.  The `p_value` column contains a measure of evidence for whether the true frequencies are equal or not. 

```{r}
inspect_imb(star_1, star_2, show_plot = TRUE)
```

+ Smaller `p_value` indicates stronger evidence against the null hypothesis that the true frequency of the most common values is the same.
+ The visualisation illustrates the significance of the difference using a coloured bar overlay.  Orange bars indicate evidence of equality of the imbalance, while blue bars indicate inequality.  If a `p_value` cannot be calculated, no coloured bar is shown.
+ The significance level can be specified using the `alpha` argument to `inspect_imb()`.  The default is `alpha = 0.05`.


#### Numeric summaries

`inspect_num()` combining some of the functionality of `summary()` and `hist()` by returning summaries of numeric columns.  `inspect_num()` returns standard numerical summaries (`min`, `q1`,  `mean`, `median`,`q3`, `max`, `sd`), but also the percentage of missing entries (`pcnt_na`) and a simple histogram (`hist`).  If `show_plot = TRUE` a histogram is generated for each numeric feature.

```{r}
inspect_num(starwars, show_plot = TRUE, breaks = 10)
```

The `hist` column is a list whose elements are tibbles each containing the relative frequencies of bins for each feature.  These tibbles are used to generate the histograms when `show_plot = TRUE`.  For example, the histogram for `starwars$birth_year` is

```{r}
inspect_num(starwars)$hist$birth_year
```


#### Categorical levels

`inspect_cat()` returns a tibble summarising categorical features in a data frame, combining the functionality of the `inspect_imb()` and `table()` functions. If `show_plot = TRUE` a barplot is generated showing the relative split.  The tibble generated contains the columns  

+ `col_name` name of each categorical column
+ `cnt` the number of unique levels in the feature
+ `common` the most common level (see also `inspect_imb()`)  
+ `common_pcnt` the percentage occurrence of the most dominant level  
+ `levels` a list of tibbles each containing frequency tabulations of all levels

```{r}
inspect_cat(starwars, show_plot = T)
```

For example, the levels for the `hair_color` column are

```{r}
inspect_cat(starwars)$levels$hair_color
```

Note that by default, if `NA` values are present, they are counted as a distinct categorical level.
