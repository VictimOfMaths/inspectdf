\title{Report and compare columnwise imbalance for non-numeric columns in one or two dataframes.}
\usage{
report_imb(df1, df2 = NULL, show_plot = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{df1}{A data frame}

\item{df2}{An optional second data frame for comparing columnwise imbalance.
Defaults to \code{NULL}.}

\item{show_plot}{Logical argument determining whether plot is returned
in addition to tibble output.  Default is \code{FALSE}.}
}
\value{
A tibble summarising and comparing the imbalance for each non-numeric column 
in one or a pair of data frames.
}
\description{
Report and compare columnwise imbalance for non-numeric columns in one or two dataframes.
}
\details{
When a single data frame is specified, a tibble is returned which 
contains columnwise imbalance, with columns
\itemize{
  \item \code{col_name} character vector containing column names of \code{df1}.
  \item \code{value} character vector containing the most common categorical level 
  in each column of \code{df1}.
  \item \code{pcnt} the percentage of each column's entries occupied by the level in
  \code{value} column.
  \item \code{cnt} the number of occurrences of the most common categorical level in each
  column of \code{df1}.
}
When both \code{df1} and \code{df2} are specified, the most common levels in \code{df1} 
are compared to columns in \code{df2}.  If a categorical column appears in
both dataframes, a simple test is performed to test the null hypothesis that the rate of 
occurrence of the common level in \code{df1} is the same in both dataframes.  
The resulting tibble has columns
\itemize{
  \item \code{col_name} character vector containing column names of \code{df1} and 
  \code{df2}.
  \item \code{value} character vector containing the most common categorical level 
  in each column of \code{df1}.  
  \item \code{pcnt_} the percentage of each column's entries occupied by the level in
  \code{value} column.
  \item \code{cnt_} the number of occurrences of the most common categorical level in each
  column of \code{df1} and \code{df2}.
}
}
\examples{
data("starwars", package = "dplyr")
# get tibble of most common levels
report_imb(starwars)
# get most common levels and show as barplot
report_imb(starwars, show_plot = TRUE)
# compare memory usage 
report_imb(starwars, starwars[1:10, -3])
}
